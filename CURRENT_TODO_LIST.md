### **📊 Code Coverage System Setup**
- ✅ **Setup code coverage** - Installed coverage.py, configured, created test runner
- ✅ **Moved htmlcov** - Relocated coverage reports to `scripts/tests/htmlcov/`
- ✅ **Created coverage runner** - `scripts/tests/run_coverage.py` for easy coverage analysis

## 🚀 **CURRENT PRIORITIES**

### **📋 Missing Test Files (High Priority)**
1. **Create missing script tests** - Need tests for: `02_face_grouper.py`, `04_multi_crop_tool.py`, `06_web_duplicate_finder.py`
2. **Create utility tests** - Need tests for: `utils/character_processor.py`, `utils/duplicate_checker.py`, `utils/recursive_file_mover.py`, `utils/similarity_viewer.py`, `utils/triplet_deduplicator.py`, `utils/triplet_mover.py`

### **📊 Code Coverage Analysis (Medium Priority)**
3. **Analyze coverage report** - Review `scripts/tests/htmlcov/index.html` for coverage gaps
4. **Improve code coverage** - Focus on increasing test coverage for critical scripts

### **📚 Code Conventions Analysis (Future)**
5. **Catalog conventions** - Analyze all scripts for reusable patterns and create reference docs

### **🔧 System Configuration (Low Priority)**
6. **Investigate Claude memory configuration** - Look into enabling memory tool in Cursor/Claude settings to improve session continuity and knowledge retention

## 📚 MAJOR ANALYSIS PROJECT: Code Conventions & Patterns

### **🎯 Catalog Conventions (Main Task)**
**Analyze all scripts to identify reusable patterns and conventions**
- **Goal**: Create comprehensive reference for consistent development
- **Scope**: All scripts in `/scripts/` directory and utilities
- **Output**: `Documents/CONVENTIONS_REFERENCE.md` with templates and best practices
- **Benefits**: Consistency, efficiency, maintainability, easier onboarding, reduced bugs
- **Strategy**: Tackle after quick wins for momentum

### **🌐 Web Tool Conventions Analysis**
**Analyze web tools for common patterns:**
- **Scripts**: 01_web_image_selector, 03_web_character_sorter, 05_web_multi_directory_viewer, 06_web_duplicate_finder
- **Patterns to catalog**:
  - Flask structure and routing patterns
  - CSS classes and styling conventions
  - JavaScript functions and modules
  - UI components and layouts
  - Error handling patterns
  - File upload/processing workflows

### **🖥️ Desktop Tool Conventions Analysis**
**Analyze desktop tools for common patterns:**
- **Scripts**: 01_desktop_image_selector_crop, 04_batch_crop_tool_multi
- **Patterns to catalog**:
  - Matplotlib setup and event handling
  - File processing workflows
  - Progress tracking systems
  - UI layouts and interactions
  - Keyboard/mouse event handling

### **🔄 Cross-Platform Conventions Analysis**
**Identify patterns that work across both web and desktop:**
- **Shared utilities**: FileTracker and ActivityTimer usage patterns
- **Common workflows**: Progress tracking and session management
- **Infrastructure**: Error handling and logging patterns
- **File operations**: Directory scanning and image processing
- **Safety patterns**: File operations and data protection

### **📖 Create Conventions Reference**
**Build comprehensive documentation:**
- **Location**: `Documents/CONVENTIONS_REFERENCE.md`
- **Content**: Code templates and best practices
- **Organization**: Categorized by tool type and functionality
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use code snippets for common patterns
- **Examples**: Real code examples from existing tools

## 🎯 STRATEGIC APPROACH

### **📋 Task Categories & Priority**
1. **🚀 QUICK WINS** - Knock out first 3-4 items quickly for momentum
2. **📋 MAINTENANCE TASKS** - Test maintenance section (completed items for reference)
3. **🎯 WORKFLOW TASKS** - Photo processing workflow, identify and process directories
4. **📚 ANALYSIS TASKS** - Bigger projects (catalog conventions, analyze patterns, create reference docs)

### **⚡ Execution Strategy**
**When you return:**
1. **Start with Quick Wins** - Git issue, redundant text, title updates (build momentum)
2. **Tackle Single Keep Logic** - More complex but well-defined
3. **Move to Analysis Projects** - When we have more time for comprehensive work

**Key Insight**: The git tracking issue should definitely be first - that's probably just a simple configuration or path issue that we can solve in minutes!

## 🔍 Future Investigation Items

### **Web Interface Template System**
**Investigate template design for web tools consolidation:**
- **Scope**: 01_web_image_selector, 03_web_character_sorter, 05_web_multi_directory_viewer
- **Common elements**: Same header, color palette (WEB_STYLE_GUIDE.md), similar JavaScript patterns
- **Shared functionality**: Image clicking, delete buttons, crop operations, navigation
- **Goal**: Determine if template would simplify maintenance or add complexity
- **Benefits**: Easier updates, consistent UI, reduced code duplication
- **Considerations**: Balance between reusability and tool-specific customization
