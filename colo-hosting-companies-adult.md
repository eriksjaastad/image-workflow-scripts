# Colocation Providers for High-Value, Legal Adult Content Generation

You are correct that reliability, financial stability, and a history of operation are major factors when hosting expensive, critical, custom hardware. We need a partner with a strong track record who is also explicitly permissive regarding your content.

Based on history and confirmed policies, here are the two strongest US-based options that meet your criteria for reliability and content permissiveness: **Lunavi (formerly Green House Data)** and **Psychz Networks**.

## 1. Top Candidate: Lunavi (Formerly Green House Data)

Lunavi is the strongest candidate on the basis of **history and explicit policy**. They successfully bridge enterprise-grade stability with permissive colocation content rules.

They emphasize **compliance (HIPAA, SSAE 16 Type II)** and **sustainability**, which speaks to enterprise-grade operations and stability. | **High Reliability.** Long operational history, major enterprise partners, and high-level compliance certifications. |
| **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** | Their AUP explicitly states: "Because we can swap IP addresses and assign them to the owners of these accounts, we **allow our dedicated and colocation customers to have adult content on their servers.**" (Strictly forbidding illegal content like exploitation of minors). | **Explicitly Permissive.** This is the clear, unambiguous language you need. They treat colocation differently and accept legal adult content. |
| **US Locations** | Data centers in the US across Wyoming, Washington, Colorado, Georgia, Texas, New Jersey, and New York. | **US-Based.** Addresses your concern about offshore hosting. |

## 💡 Recommended Next Steps

Given your requirements for a US-based, stable provider with a clear history and policy:

1.  **Contact the sales teams** at both **Lunavi** and **Psychz Networks**.
2.  **Confirm the specific pricing and availability** for your required colocation space (rack unit, power).
3.  **Request a final, written confirmation or a copy of the *current* Colocation Service Agreement and AUP** to ensure the policy on **generating** 3D content (not just hosting the finished files) is covered and acceptable.
