# September 2025 Backfill Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025

## Problem

September 2025 data was showing **inflated numbers** (~20,000-28,000 files) in the dashboard charts because:
- Dashboard was reading **raw FileTracker logs** (which count all files: PNGs + YAMLs + captions)
- Daily summaries didn't exist for September (started Oct 1st)
- October+ data was accurate because it uses daily summaries (PNG-only counts)

## Solution

1. ✅ **Updated `cleanup_logs.py`** to read archived logs (`.gz` files in `log_archives/`)
2. ✅ **Created `backfill_september_summaries.py`** script to generate historical summaries
3. ✅ **Backfilled all 30 days** of September 2025 with proper summaries

## Results

**Before:**
- Sept 20: ~20,000 file operations (all files)
- Sept 23: ~28,000 file operations (all files)

**After:**
- Sept 20: ~10,000 operations (proper counts)
- Sept 23: ~32,000 operations (proper counts, but this was a huge project - tattersail + jmlimages)

## Cron Job Status

Your cron job is **correct and working**:
```bash
0 2 * * * cd "/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/Eros Mate" && python scripts/cleanup_logs.py --process-date $(date -d "2 days ago" +%Y%m%d)
```

This runs daily at 2 AM and creates summaries with a 2-day buffer.

**No timer-related cron jobs** exist - the cron only consolidates file operations.

## What Changed

### `cleanup_logs.py`
- Now reads archived logs (`log_archives/*.gz`) for historical dates
- Handles both `file_operations_YYYYMMDD.log.gz` and `file_operations_YYYYMMDD_archived.log.gz` formats

### New Script: `backfill_september_summaries.py`
- Processes Sept 1-30, 2025
- Creates daily summaries for each date
- Skips existing summaries
- Uses `cleanup_logs.py` under the hood

## Next Steps

**Restart your dashboard** and September data will now be accurate!

The chart should now show:
- Consistent methodology (daily summaries) for all dates
- No more inflated September numbers
- Historical accuracy
