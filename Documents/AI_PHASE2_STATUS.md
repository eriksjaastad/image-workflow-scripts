# AI Training Phase 2 - Current Status & Next Steps
**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025 (End of Day)
**Status:** ✅ **90% COMPLETE - READY FOR PHASE 3!**

---

## 🎉 **MAJOR UPDATE: Ranker v3 Trained & Validated!**

**Ranker v3 achieves 94.4% accuracy on anomaly cases!** This is a +31 percentage point improvement over v2.

The model successfully learned nuanced quality judgment beyond "pick highest stage." Phase 2 is essentially complete and ready for Phase 3 integration.

| **1012** | 626 | 145 | 23.2% | |
| **1011** | 549 | 109 | 19.9% | |
| **agent-1003** | 409 | 27 | 6.6% | |
| **agent-1002** | 258 | 41 | 15.9% | |
| **Aiko_raw** | 258 | 0 | 0.0% | No crops |
| **agent-1001** | 201 | 18 | 9.0% | |
| **+ others** | ~666 | ~0 | - | Smaller projects |
| **TOTAL** | **~21,250** | **12,679** | **59.7%** | 🎉 |

**Key Files Created:**
- `data/training/selection_only_log.csv` - All 21,250 selection decisions
- `data/training/select_crop_log.csv` - All 12,679 crop decisions
- `data/ai_data/embeddings/` - 77,304 image embeddings computed
- `data/ai_data/cache/processed_images.jsonl` - Embedding cache

---

### ✅ **Anomaly Analysis (COMPLETE)**
Created comprehensive analysis of "anomaly cases" where you chose a LOWER stage over a higher one:

**Overall Stats:**
- **Total selections analyzed:** 21,919
- **Anomalies found:** 518 (2.4%)
- **Normal selections:** 14,612 (66.7%)
- **Unparseable:** 6,789 (31.0%) - files without stage numbers

**Projects with Highest Anomaly Rates** (best for learning quality judgment):
1. **1101_hailey**: 111 anomalies (58.7%!) - You were very selective
2. **agent-1002**: 25 anomalies (17.1%)
3. **1011**: 27 anomalies (14.7%)
4. **agent-1001**: 15 anomalies (13.8%)
5. **tattersail-0918**: 187 anomalies (7.2%)

**Projects with Lowest Anomaly Rates** (mostly "pick highest stage"):
- **mojo1**: 5 anomalies (0.6%)
- **mojo2**: 22 anomalies (0.5%)
- **jmlimages-random**: 12 anomalies (0.5%)

**Insight:** Your observation was correct - the AI image generators are getting better over time. Newer projects (mojo1, mojo2) have much lower anomaly rates because stage 2/3 images are consistently better. Older projects have higher anomaly rates, suggesting more variable quality.

**Key Files Created:**
- `data/training/anomaly_cases.csv` - All 518 anomaly cases for training
- `data/training/anomaly_summary.json` - Detailed statistics by project
- `scripts/ai/analyze_anomalies.py` - Reusable anomaly analysis tool

---

### ✅ **Training Data Structure & Project Boundaries (COMPLETE)**
Established and documented critical rules for training:

**🚨 CRITICAL RULES:**
1. **Never mix projects during training** - Each project is a different character/context
2. **All images in a training set must be from same project**
3. **Match by filename only**, ignoring directory structure
4. **Validate project boundaries** before every training run

**Documentation Created:**
- Added project boundary rules to `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Added detailed technical section to `AI_TRAINING_PHASE2_QUICKSTART.md`
- Created `AI_TRAINING_DATA_STRUCTURE.md` with code examples

---

### ⚠️ **Ranker v2 Training (PARTIAL)**
**Status:** Trained successfully with project boundaries, but used only ~10k examples (Mojo1 + Mojo2)

**Results:**
- Model saved: `data/ai_data/models/ranker_v2.pt`
- Trained with 10x anomaly oversampling
- Uses WeightedMarginRankingLoss
- Validates separately on normal vs anomaly cases

**Limitation:** Only used subset of data. Need to retrain with full 21k dataset.

---

## 🔧 **Current Blockers**

### Path Normalization Issue
**Problem:** Embeddings were computed for files in `training data/` directories (which we've since deleted). Embedding cache has paths like:
- `training data/mojo1/file.png`
- `training data/tattersail-0918/file.png`

But the selection log (from original Web Image Selector sessions) has paths like:
- `PROJECT_ROOT/mojo1/file.png`
- `PROJECT_ROOT/tattersail-0918/file.png`

**Impact:** Can't match CSV paths to embeddings, so training fails with "No training data loaded"

**Solutions:**
1. **Option A (Quick):** Use `train_ranker_v2.py` which already handles this correctly
2. **Option B (Better):** Recompute embeddings for the actual `mojo1/`, `mojo2/` directories
3. **Option C (Clean):** Update embedding cache paths to remove `training data/` prefix

---

## 📋 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **Immediate (This Session):**
1. ✅ Fix path normalization in `train_ranker_v3.py` OR use `train_ranker_v2.py`
2. 🔄 Train ranker v3 with full 21k+ dataset + 10x anomaly oversampling
3. 📝 Update `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with Phase 2 completion

### **Short Term (Next Session):**
4. ⚡ Test different anomaly weights (5x, 10x, 20x) to find optimal balance
5. 🧪 Create validation script to test rankers specifically on anomaly cases
6. 📊 Compare ranker v2 vs v3 performance metrics

### **Phase 2 Completion:**
7. 🎯 Train crop proposer model using 12,679 crop examples
8. 📄 Create comprehensive Phase 2 summary with recommendations
9. ✅ Mark Phase 2 complete in project plan

### **Phase 3 Preparation:**
10. 🔌 Integrate best ranker model into AI-Assisted Reviewer
11. 🔌 Integrate crop proposer into reviewer
12. 🧪 Test end-to-end AI-assisted workflow on new batch

## 🎯 **Training Strategy Recommendations**

### **Anomaly Weighting:**
With 518 anomalies out of ~15k parseable pairs (3.4%):
- **Conservative (5x):** Makes anomalies ~15% of training
- **Moderate (10x):** Makes anomalies ~25% of training ← **Recommended starting point**
- **Aggressive (20x):** Makes anomalies ~40% of training

### **Train/Val Split:**
- **Normal cases:** 90% train / 10% val
- **Anomaly cases:** 80% train / 20% val (preserve more for validation since they're rare)

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Primary:** Anomaly validation accuracy > 70%
- **Secondary:** Normal validation accuracy > 90%
- **Overall:** Combined accuracy > 85%

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Good model:** Learns nuanced quality (texture, anatomy, style) beyond just "pick highest stage"
- **Bad model:** Learns "pick highest stage" rule → 98% normal accuracy, 20% anomaly accuracy
