# Mid-Day Project Fix - Date vs DateTime Comparison

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Projects starting mid-day (like mixed-0919 at 2 PM) were missing from charts

## The Problem

**Daily summaries** have timestamps at midnight (00:00:00), but **projects can start mid-day**.

The date-based matching was using **datetime comparison** instead of **date comparison**:

```python
# OLD (datetime comparison)
if rec_dt < start_dt:  # 2025-09-29 00:00 < 2025-09-29 14:00 → EXCLUDED!
    continue
```

This excluded any project that started after midnight on the same day.

## Affected Projects

| Project | Started | Issue |
|---------|---------|-------|
| mixed-0919 | Sept 29 at 2:00 PM | Daily summary at midnight excluded |
| 1101_Hailey | Sept 15 at 3:00 PM | Daily summary at midnight excluded |
| dalia | Sept 28 at 7:20 PM | Daily summary at midnight excluded |

## The Fix

Changed to **date-only comparison** in `data_engine.py` lines 664-696:

```python
# NEW (date comparison)
rec_date = rec_dt.date()  # Extract date only
start_date = start_dt.date()  # Extract date only

if rec_date < start_date:  # 2025-09-29 < 2025-09-29 → SAME DAY!
    continue
```

Now projects match if the **date** overlaps, regardless of time-of-day.

## Results

**Before:** 4 projects (Mojo1, Mojo2, jmlimages-random, tattersail-0918)

**After:** 7 projects
- 1101_Hailey (581 files) ✅ NEW
- Mojo1 (38,863 files)
- Mojo2 (14,480 files)
- dalia (59 files) ✅ CORRECTED
- jmlimages-random (32,951 files) ✅ EXPANDED
- mixed-0919 (1,177 files) ✅ NEW
- tattersail-0918 (24,312 files)

## Why This Matters

**Real-world workflow:**
1. You start a project at 2 PM
2. Work for 6 hours
3. Finish at 8 PM
4. FileTracker logs operations throughout

**Daily summary:**
- Created next day
- Timestamp: midnight (arbitrary)
- Should match ANY project active that day

**The fix ensures:**
- Projects working any time during a day are captured
- No more missing mid-day projects
- Accurate representation of daily work
