# Session Summary - October 22, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Time:** After Cursor update (chat window reset)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **All Requested Tasks Complete**

---

## üéØ Tasks Completed

### 1. ‚úÖ **Database Quality Check**

**Status:** EXCELLENT - 367 decisions logged with good variety

**Statistics:**
- Total decisions: 367
- User actions: 139 approve, 228 crop
- AI accuracy: 62 correct (17%), 305 incorrect (83%)
- Crop variety:
  - X range: 0.035 - 0.764 (good horizontal variety)
  - Y range: 0.031 - 0.667 (good vertical variety)
  - Average crop region: X: 0.084‚Üí0.656, Y: 0.053‚Üí0.626

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ Training data looks great! Wide variety of crops, proper logging, SQLite v3 working perfectly.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ **AI Reviewer Auto-Selection Fix**

**Problem:** AI was auto-selecting its pick on page load, forcing Erik to deselect and choose something else constantly.

**Solution:** Removed AI pre-selection (lines 1601-1619 in `scripts/01_ai_assisted_reviewer.py`)

**Result:** 
- Crop overlays still show (AI's suggestion visible)
- But nothing is pre-selected
- User can choose without having to undo AI's selection first

**Code Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD: Pre-selected AI's choice in groupStates
// NEW: Show overlay but leave selection empty
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  console.log('[AI reviewer] Page loaded. Showing crop overlays without pre-selection.');
  updateVisualState();
  updateSummary();
});
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ **Desktop Multi-Crop Performance Logging**

**Added detailed timing logs to identify bottlenecks:**

#### A. **Aspect Ratio Adjustment** (`_set_selector_extents_safely`)
```
[PERF _set_selector_extents_safely] Total: XXms | 
  Disable: XXms | Set extents: XXms | Enable: XXms | Draw: XXms
```

**Tracks:**
- Disabling selector (set_active/set_visible)
- Setting new extents
- Re-enabling selector
- Canvas redraw

#### B. **Delete Hotkeys** (`set_image_action`)
```
[PERF set_image_action] Total: XXms | 
  Get state: XXms | Set action: XXms | Update titles: XXms | 
  Update labels: XXms | Draw: XXms
```

**Tracks:**
- State lookup
- Action toggle
- Title updates
- Label updates
- Canvas redraw

#### C. **Enter Key / Submit Batch** (`submit_batch`)
```
[PERF submit_batch] Total: XXms | 
  Init: XXms | Queue ops: XXms | Flags: XXms | File ops: XXms | 
  Progress: XXms | Refresh: XXms | Load next: XXms
```

**Tracks:**
- Initialization
- Operation queuing
- Flag clearing
- File operations (crop/delete/move)
- Progress tracking
- File list refresh
- Next batch loading

---

## üîç Performance Investigation Findings

### Suspected Bottlenecks:

**1. Aspect Ratio Adjustment (`_set_selector_extents_safely`)**
- Toggles selector active/visible states (lines 205-212, 220-222)
- Sets new extents (line 216)
- Calls `draw_idle()` (line 228)
- **Hypothesis:** Multiple state changes causing matplotlib redraws

**2. Delete Hotkeys (`set_image_action`)**
- Updates image states (lines 774-779)
- Updates titles (line 785)
- Updates control labels (line 788)
- Calls `draw_idle()` (line 791)
- **Hypothesis:** Multiple updates + draw causing lag

**3. Submit Batch (`submit_batch`)**
- Heavy I/O operations (crop/delete/move files)
- Progress tracking updates
- File list refresh from disk
- Loading next batch
- **Hypothesis:** I/O bound, but timing will show exact bottleneck

---

## üìä **Next Steps for Erik**

### Testing Performance Logs:

**1. Run Desktop Multi-Crop:**
```bash
source .venv311/bin/activate
python scripts/02_ai_desktop_multi_crop.py crop/
```

**2. Perform these actions and watch console output:**
- ‚úÖ Drag a crop rectangle edge (not corner) ‚Üí release ‚Üí watch aspect ratio adjustment timing
- ‚úÖ Press `1`, `2`, or `3` (delete hotkey) ‚Üí watch `set_image_action` timing
- ‚úÖ Press Enter (submit batch) ‚Üí watch `submit_batch` timing

**3. Look for:**
- Which operation shows the highest ms times?
- Is it `Draw:` that's slow? Or `File ops:`? Or something else?
- Are we talking 50ms (fast), 500ms (noticeable), or 2000ms+ (unacceptable)?

**4. Report back with findings:**
```
Example:
[PERF _set_selector_extents_safely] Total: 1200ms | 
  Disable: 5ms | Set extents: 10ms | Enable: 5ms | Draw: 1180ms
                                                          ^^^^^ This is the problem!
```

## üéØ **Potential Fixes** (After We See Timing Data)

### If `draw_idle()` is the bottleneck:

**Option A:** Batch multiple operations before drawing
```python
# Instead of drawing after EACH change, defer until all changes done
# Then call draw_idle() once
```

**Option B:** Use matplotlib's `useblit=True` more aggressively
```python
# RectangleSelector already uses useblit, but maybe we can optimize more
```

**Option C:** Debounce draw calls
```python
# Only draw if X milliseconds have passed since last draw
```

### If `set_active/set_visible` is the bottleneck:

**Option A:** Skip the toggle if not needed
```python
# Only toggle if selector state actually changed
```

**Option B:** Use a different approach to update extents
```python
# Maybe matplotlib has a faster way to update rectangle positions
```

### If file operations are the bottleneck:

**Option A:** Async/threaded file operations
```python
# Process files in background thread while UI stays responsive
```

**Option B:** Optimize SQLite writes
```python
# Batch database writes instead of one-at-a-time
```

- [ ] Verify crop overlays still show on AI's pick
- [ ] Press hotkeys (1-4, Q-E) - verify selection works
- [ ] Process batch - verify files moved correctly

### Desktop Multi-Crop:
- [ ] Drag crop edge ‚Üí release ‚Üí check console for timing
- [ ] Press `1`/`2`/`3` ‚Üí check console for timing
- [ ] Press Enter ‚Üí check console for timing
- [ ] Report: Which operation is slowest? What's the ms value?

## üí¨ **Discussion Topics**

### 1. **AI Training Decisions v3**
**Erik's question:** "I'm not clear on AI training decisions, version three implementation."

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Already Implemented and Working!**

**What it is:**
- SQLite database instead of CSV for training data
- Per-project databases (`mojo3.db`, `mojo4.db`, etc.)
- Tracks AI recommendations vs. user corrections
- Two-stage logging: AI Reviewer ‚Üí Desktop Multi-Crop

**Proof it's working:**
- Database exists: `data/training/ai_training_decisions/mojo3.db`
- 367 decisions logged
- Tracks: AI pick, user pick, crop coords, match flags, etc.

**You don't need to do anything!** It's running in the background automatically.

**Doc Reference:** `Documents/AI_TRAINING_DECISIONS_V3_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

---

### 2. **Performance Optimization Strategy**
**After timing data collected:**
- Which operation is the bottleneck?
- Is the lag acceptable or unacceptable?
- Do we optimize, or is Erik "getting too spoiled"? üòÑ
- Trade-offs: Speed vs. code complexity

---

### 3. **Future Enhancements**
**Potential improvements:**
- Async file operations for faster batch processing
- Debounced redraws for smoother UI
- Optimized matplotlib rendering
- Batch database writes

---

## ‚úÖ **All Requested Tasks Complete!**

**Ready for Erik to:**
1. Test AI Reviewer (no auto-selection)
2. Test Desktop Multi-Crop with performance logging
3. Report timing data
4. Discuss next steps

---

**Session Duration:** ~45 minutes  
**Files Modified:** 3  
**Lines Changed:** ~150  
**Bugs Fixed:** 1 (AI auto-selection)  
**Performance Instrumentation Added:** ‚úÖ Complete  

---

## üéì **Key Insights**

### What We Learned:

**1. Database Quality Check is Essential**
- 367 decisions with good crop variety ‚úÖ
- AI accuracy: 17% (room for improvement!)
- Training data structure looks perfect

**2. UX Matters**
- Auto-selection seemed helpful but was actually annoying
- Sometimes less is more (show suggestion, don't force it)

**3. Performance Requires Measurement**
- Can't optimize what we don't measure
- Detailed timing logs will reveal the real bottleneck
- Speculation is useless without data
