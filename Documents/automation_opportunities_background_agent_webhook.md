# Automation Opportunities – Background Agent & Webhook Concepts

This document gives a plain‑English overview of how Cursor’s **Background Agents** and related automation features could be used. The goal is to help Claude look at our project and suggest processes we might automate.

---

## 1. Code Generation
*Have the AI write code or boilerplate from a specification.*  
Examples:
- Generate similar wrappers or scripts for multiple endpoints.
- Scaffold a starter CLI or template for a new process.

**Why it matters:** Removes repetitive, low‑value work when patterns repeat.

---

## 2. Scheduled Refactors vs. Linters
- **Linters** automatically fix *small style* issues (spacing, imports).
- **Refactors** change *structure or semantics* (rename functions, split long files, migrate patterns).

Examples of automated refactors:
- Nightly rename functions to a naming convention.
- Split large files into modules.
- Extract duplicate utilities into a shared helper.

**Why it matters:** Keeps codebases clean and consistent without manual effort.

---

## 3. Webhooks (Triggers)
*A webhook is a URL that receives a POST when something happens.*  
Examples of triggers:
- GitHub → Cursor: on pull request opened, trigger an AI review.
- Make.com → Cursor: when a scenario finishes, trigger a summary.
- Calendar → Cursor: nightly, generate a prep or journal note.

**Why it matters:** Automations run at the right time instead of you remembering.

---

## 4. Background Agents (Automatic Tasks)
*Cursor agents can run jobs with prompts + context without you sitting there.*  
Possible use cases:
- **Nightly cleanup:** “Scan repo, find duplicate helpers, propose one shared util.”
- **Doc sync:** “Read new Make scenarios → generate README sections + diagrams.”
- **Journal bot:** “Summarize today’s chats/commits into `YYYY-MM-DD__journal.md`.”

**Why it matters:** Shifts from manual “click and wait” to automated, scheduled helpers.

---

## 5. Starter Opportunities for This Project
Claude could look for:
- **Recurring tasks** (generating similar files, summarizing, documenting).
- **Repeated cleanup** (naming, splitting, migrating patterns).
- **Events** (commits, scenario runs, daily schedule) that could trigger automated notes or actions.

### Prompt to Claude
> “Read this project and suggest which of these concepts (code generation, scheduled refactors, webhooks, background agents) could save time here. Focus on practical, low‑risk automations first.”
