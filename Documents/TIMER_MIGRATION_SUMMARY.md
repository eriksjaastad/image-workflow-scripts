# Timer Migration: Quick Summary

## ‚úÖ **Migration Complete!**

---

## What Changed

### Before:
- ‚ùå ActivityTimer + FileTracker (dual tracking)
- ‚ùå Break detection removing 95% of work time
- ‚ùå Timestamp format mismatches causing bugs
- ‚ùå Complex calculations merging two data sources
- ‚ùå Result: 0.7h for 4 days of work (impossible!)

### After:
- ‚úÖ FileTracker only (single source of truth)
- ‚úÖ Elapsed time per day (first op to last op)
- ‚úÖ Unified timestamp handling
- ‚úÖ Simple calculations from file operations
- ‚úÖ Result: 15.4h for 4 days of work (realistic!)

---

## How It Works Now

**Every button click = file operation = automatic tracking!**

```
You click "Select" ‚Üí Image moves to selected/
  ‚Üì
FileTracker logs:
  - timestamp
  - operation (move)
  - file_count
  - source/dest
  ‚Üì
Dashboard calculates:
  - Hours = elapsed time per day
  - Days = unique dates with operations
  - img/h = images / hours
```

## Key Files Updated

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `companion_file_utils.py` | New elapsed time algorithm | Accurate hours |
| `analytics.py` | Date-based filtering, datetime handling | Per-project metrics |
| `productivity_dashboard.py` | Same fixes | Consistent calculations |
| `02_web_character_sorter.py` | Removed dead timer code | Cleaner code |
| `00_start_project.py` | NEW: Project startup script | Easy project creation |
| `00_finish_project.py` | NEW: Project finish script | Clean project completion |

---

## All Your Scripts Are Covered

| Script | Tracks? | How? |
|--------|---------|------|
| 01_web_image_selector | ‚úÖ | Move to selected/, Delete |
| 02_web_character_sorter | ‚úÖ | Move to groups, Delete |
| 04_multi_crop_tool | ‚úÖ | Move cropped, Delete bad |
| 05_web_multi_directory_viewer | ‚úÖ | Crop (move), Delete |
| 06_web_duplicate_finder | ‚úÖ | Delete duplicates |

**No gaps. Complete coverage.**

---

## Historical Data

**Preserved** in `data/timer_data/` for reference.

Dashboard can still read old timer data if needed, but all new tracking uses FileTracker.

---

## Timestamp Format

**Unified approach:**
- Project manifests: `2025-10-15T19:30:00Z` (UTC with Z)
- File operations: `2025-10-15 15:40:34.491223` (naive local)
- Code handles both: `isinstance(ts, datetime)` check

---

## New Project Scripts

### Start Project:
```bash
python scripts/00_start_project.py
```
- Creates manifest with proper timestamps
- Counts initial images
- Sets startedAt automatically

### Finish Project:
```bash
python scripts/00_finish_project.py
```
- Sets finishedAt timestamp
- Counts final images
- Calculates metrics

**No more manual JSON editing!**

---

## Validation

### Dashboard Now Shows:

**Mojo1:**
- Web Image Selector: 15.4h / 4d / 25,069 images / 1,627 img/h ‚úÖ
- Multi Crop Tool: 26.2h / 3d / 4,388 images / 167 img/h ‚úÖ

**Mojo2:**
- Web Image Selector: 14.5h / 3d / 12,420 images / 856 img/h ‚úÖ

**All metrics are now realistic and accurate!**

---

## If You Add New Scripts

**Rule**: Make sure every user action moves or deletes a file.

If you can't move a file (e.g., just viewing), you can log a "view" operation:
```python
tracker.log_operation(
    operation="view",
    file_count=1,
    notes="User viewed image"
)
```

Dashboard will automatically include it!

## Quick Reference

**Hours = Elapsed time per day**
- Oct 1: 3PM to 5:30PM = 2.5h
- Oct 4: 2PM to 6:45PM = 4.75h
- Total: Sum across all days

**Days = Unique dates**
- Count unique dates with any operations
- Oct 1, 4, 5, 6 = 4 days

**Images = Sum of file_count**
- Count all files moved/deleted
- 25,069 total operations

**img/h = Images / Hours**
- 25,069 / 15.4 = 1,627 img/h
- Realistic throughput!

**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Result**: Simple, accurate, reliable! üéâ
