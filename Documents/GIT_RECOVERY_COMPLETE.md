# Git Repository Recovery - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

---

## 🎯 What Happened

Your local `main` branch had accidentally committed the entire `.venv311` virtual environment directory (50,466 files, 648 MB) along with other unwanted files. This happened in commit `78710b091` on Oct 23, 2025.

**Good News:** The remote `origin/main` was clean and never had this problem!

---

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. **Git Repository Cleaned** ✓
- Local `main` branch reset to match clean `origin/main` (commit 733ded40f)
- Removed 50,200+ files that shouldn't have been committed
- Main branch is now clean and synced with origin
- Created backup branches before any changes

### 2. **All Data Files Recovered** ✓
Recovered **144 files** from backup branch:
- ✅ `data/timesheet.csv` - Your billing/timesheet data (2,758 bytes)
- ✅ `data/schema/ai_training_decisions_v3.sql` - Missing SQL schema (4,700 bytes)
- ✅ `data/aggregates/` - 36 aggregate files
- ✅ `data/daily_summaries/` - 40 daily summary files
- ✅ `data/crop_progress/` - 6 progress tracking files
- ✅ `data/sorter_progress/` - 31 sorter progress files
- ✅ `data/data/snapshot/` - 27 snapshot event files
- ✅ `data/character_analysis*.json` - Character analysis files

All recovered files are properly ignored by `.gitignore` (as they should be for data safety).

### 3. **Virtual Environment Rebuilt** ✓
- Removed corrupted `.venv311` directory
- Created fresh Python 3.11 virtual environment
- Installed all dashboard packages (fastapi, uvicorn, flask, etc.)
- Ready for use

### 4. **Improved .gitignore** ✓
Added missing entries:
- `crop_auto/` (6.8 GB)
- `crop_cropped/` (750 MB)
- `mojo3/` (13 MB)

### 5. **Cleanup Completed** ✓
- Removed 2 empty directories (`training_snapshots`, `dashboard_archives`)
- No remaining empty directories in `data/`

## 📊 Current State

### Git Branches
```
✓ main                              (clean, synced with origin)
✓ claude/initial-setup-...          (working branch, clean)
✓ backup/main-corrupted-...         (safety backup with all your data)
✓ backup/before-cleanup-...         (previous backup)
```

### Data Integrity
- ✅ All important data files recovered and present
- ✅ Schema files complete (8 files)
- ✅ Timesheet intact
- ✅ AI training data preserved
- ✅ Progress tracking files restored

### Repository Health
- ✅ No large files committed to main (except legitimate 18MB cache file)
- ✅ No virtual environment files in git
- ✅ No accidentally committed binaries
- ✅ Pre-commit hook active (blocks project name)
- ✅ All untracked large directories properly ignored

## 📁 Backup Locations

**All your data is safe in multiple places:**

1. **Working directory:** All 144 recovered files are in `data/` directories
2. **Git backup branch:** `backup/main-corrupted-20251025-144705`
   - Contains the complete state before cleanup
   - Keep this for at least a month as insurance
3. **Remote origin:** Clean, authoritative version of code

## 🛠️ Tools Created

### 1. System Diagnostic Script
**Location:** `scripts/tools/system_diagnostic.py`

Comprehensive health check that verifies:
- Python environment and packages
- Git repository status
- File system structure
- Branch analysis and large files
- Git hooks configuration

**Usage:**
```bash
.venv311/bin/python scripts/tools/system_diagnostic.py
```

### 2. Data Recovery Script
**Location:** `scripts/tools/recover_data_from_backup.py`

Automated recovery of data files from backup branch.

**Usage:**
```bash
.venv311/bin/python scripts/tools/recover_data_from_backup.py
```

### 3. Disaster Recovery Plan
**Location:** `GIT_DISASTER_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`

Complete documentation of:
- What went wrong
- How we fixed it
- Step-by-step recovery procedures
- Prevention strategies

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
The local `main` branch diverged from `origin/main` with a commit that included:
- Entire `.venv311/` directory (should have been ignored)
- Development artifacts (.coverage, etc.)

This happened even though `.gitignore` had `.venv311/` listed - likely due to:
- Files were added before `.gitignore` was updated, OR
- `git add .` or `git add -A` was used with files already staged

### Prevention Measures Now in Place
1. ✅ Comprehensive `.gitignore` with all data/venv directories
2. ✅ Pre-commit hook blocks project name leaks
3. ✅ Diagnostic script to check repository health
4. ✅ Documentation of recovery procedures
5. ✅ Regular backup branches created automatically

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
cd "/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/Eros Mate"

# 1. Check git status
git status
# Should show: "On branch claude/initial-setup-..." or "main"
# Should show modified .gitignore and new diagnostic scripts

# 2. Verify main is clean
git checkout main
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 733ded40f CRITICAL: Remove accidentally committed production data

# 3. Check for large files in main (should be minimal)
git ls-tree -r --long main | awk '$4 > 10000000 {print $4/1000000 "MB", $5}'
# Should only show legitimate large files (18MB cache, 5-6MB models)

# 4. Verify timesheet exists
cat data/timesheet.csv | head -5
# Should show your timesheet data

# 5. Check Python environment
.venv311/bin/python --version
.venv311/bin/pip list | grep -E "(fastapi|flask|pyyaml)"
# Should show Python 3.11 and all packages installed

# 6. Run diagnostic
.venv311/bin/python scripts/tools/system_diagnostic.py
# Should show all checks passing
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Review recovered files** - Make sure all your data looks correct
2. **Test your workflows** - Try running the dashboard and scripts
3. **Keep backup branch** - Don't delete `backup/main-corrupted-*` for at least 30 days
4. **Consider committing improvements:**
   ```bash
   git checkout claude/initial-setup-011CUQcxYK5MCd28FQqkSZrL
   git add .gitignore
   git add scripts/tools/system_diagnostic.py
   git add scripts/tools/recover_data_from_backup.py
   git add GIT_DISASTER_RECOVERY_PLAN.md
   git commit -m "Add recovery tools and improve .gitignore"
   ```
