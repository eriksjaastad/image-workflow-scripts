# AI-Assisted Reviewer Clone + AI Integration
**Status:** Active
**Audience:** Developers

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Strategy:** Clone web_image_selector.py and add AI features, NOT build from scratch

---

## üéØ **Core Principle:**
**"AI-Assisted Reviewer WITH AI integration"**

NOT: "AI tool that kinda works like web selector"  
YES: "Exact clone of web selector + AI recommendations"

---

## üìã **Checklist: What Must Be Identical**

### **1. Configuration (Top of File)**
```python
# From web_image_selector.py
BATCH_SIZE = 100  # ‚Üê AT TOP, easy to find!
THUMBNAIL_MAX_DIM = 768
STAGE_NAMES = ("stage1_generated", "stage1.5_face_swapped", "stage2_upscaled")
FOCUS_TIMER_WORK_MIN = 15
FOCUS_TIMER_REST_MIN = 5
```

### **2. Hotkeys (Exact Match)**
```javascript
'1', '2', '3', '4'  ‚Üí Select image (no crop) + auto-advance
'q', 'w', 'e', 'r'  ‚Üí Select WITH crop + auto-advance
'Enter' / 'Space'   ‚Üí Next group
'ArrowUp'           ‚Üí Previous group
```

### **3. Workflow (Exact Match)**
1. Load batch of 100 groups
2. User makes selections (queued in memory)
3. Scroll to bottom to enable "Finalize selections" button
4. Click finalize ‚Üí ALL operations execute
5. Option to load next batch

### **4. Button Names**
- "Finalize selections" (not "Process" or "Submit")

### **5. UI Structure**
- Compact header
- Batch count at top
- Groups as scrollable sections
- "Finalize" button at bottom (disabled until scroll)

## ü§ñ **AI Integration Points (ADDITIONS ONLY)**

1. **On page load:** Run AI for current batch
2. **Visual indicators:** 
   - AI PICK badge
   - CROP badge if AI suggests crop
   - Crop overlay (red 1px box)
3. **Default behavior:**
   - AI pick is pre-selected visually
   - Pressing Enter accepts AI recommendation
4. **Override:**
   - Use hotkeys to override AI pick
   - AI suggestion doesn't block user

---

## üîß **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1:** Copy web selector structure
- Batch loading
- Hotkey system
- Finalize button
- Auto-advance logic

**Phase 2:** Add AI (minimal changes)
- Call AI on batch load
- Display recommendations
- Show crop overlay
- Log training data

**Result:** Web selector that happens to have AI helping you

---

**Key:** If web selector has it, we must have it. If web selector doesn't, we probably don't need it either.
