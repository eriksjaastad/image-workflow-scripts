# Testing the Optimized Dashboard
**Status:** Active
**Audience:** Developers

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26


## Quick Test

```bash
# Start the dashboard
python scripts/dashboard/run_dashboard.py
```

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8050

## What You Should See

**Performance improvements:**
- Dashboard loads in ~11 seconds (down from 40s)
- 71% faster than before
- File operations cached (no more 19x reloading)

**In the console you'll see:**
```
[SMART LOAD] ...
[CACHE] Loaded 222815 file operations: 0.7s
[TIMING] TOTAL DASHBOARD RESPONSE TIME: 11.449s
```

## If You Want to Test the Full Optimization

To get down to ~5 seconds, you'd need to:

1. Add `finishedAt` timestamps to the 13 projects that are missing them
2. Re-run: `python scripts/data_pipeline/archive_all_finished.py`
3. This converts all archived projects to tiny bins (95% reduction)

But the **3.5x speedup you have now** should be a HUGE improvement for your daily use! ðŸš€

## Your Ideas for Next Session

From `Documents/DASHBOARD_PERFORMANCE_IDEAS.md`:
- Hourly/daily breakdown charts
- Per-chart time frames (instead of global selector)
- "Hide empty projects" checkbox for billed vs actual
- Default to showing just current + last project
- Last 24 hours quick view

All ready to implement when you're ready to tackle the UI improvements!
