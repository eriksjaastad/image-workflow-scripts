## Follow-up Review: f5970b9 (2025-10-26)

Commit: f5970b9 – "fix: address ChatGPT code review findings - race conditions, imports, and validation"

Summary of findings:

- FileTracker metadata→notes: ✅ VERIFIED
  - Updated in `scripts/process_crop_queue.py`, `scripts/02_ai_desktop_multi_crop.py`, `scripts/utils/crop_queue.py`.

- headless_crop import path: ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - Changed to `from utils.companion_file_utils import ...`. Works when `utils` is top-level, but fails under package import (`scripts.utils...`).
  - Recommended: `from .companion_file_utils import ...` or `from scripts.utils.companion_file_utils import ...`.

- Queue ID generation locking: ✅ VERIFIED
  - `enqueue_batch()` holds `LOCK_EX` while generating ID and appending using `a+`; `_generate_batch_id()` scans under same lock.

- Queue status update locking: ❌ NOT FIXED
  - `update_batch_status()` still performs read–modify–write without a single exclusive lock around the whole cycle; concurrent updates can clobber.
  - Fix: hold `LOCK_EX` on the queue file across read–modify–write (or move to SQLite).

- Preflight validation hardening: ✅ VERIFIED (with caveat)
  - Strict safe-zone whitelist enforced as error; normalized coords validated; pixel rects checked for negatives and image bounds.
  - Caveat: safe-zone check uses substring matching on the path string. Prefer `Path.parts`-based checks to avoid false positives.

- DB source-of-truth posture: ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - DB update remains best-effort at queue time; processor does not enforce/repair DB writes.
  - Consider making DB update authoritative or validating linkage during preflight.

Action items for Claude:
1) Change import in `scripts/utils/ai_crop_utils.py` to a package-relative or absolute package path.
2) Add exclusive `LOCK_EX` over the entire read–modify–write in `update_batch_status()`.
3) Make safe-zone check path-aware (inspect `Path.parts`) and confirm the whitelist matches repo policy.
4) Optional: enforce DB linkage in processor or make queue-time DB update fail-hard.
