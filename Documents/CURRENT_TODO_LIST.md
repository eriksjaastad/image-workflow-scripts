# Current TODO List - September 24, 2025

## üìÖ Update ‚Äî October 5, 2025

### ‚úÖ Completed today
- Desktop selector: 4-up single row layout with centered, tight gutters
- Copyable timestamps + hotkeys (1‚Äì4) and per-image skip (A/S/D/F), B=Skip All
- Enter behavior: no selection deletes all; selection crops one, deletes others
- Selector stability: no "ghost" handles; safe extent updates; transition guard for Skip
- Window sizing: fit-to-screen without overflow; Qt window resize
- Centralized sorter enforced in human-facing tools (desktop, web selector, multi-crop, character sorter)
- Web selector: 4th button + key; cap groups to 4 per row; pre-sort before grouping
- Shared delete utility: `safe_delete_image_and_yaml` used by web/desktop
- Tests: desktop behavior tests; sorting determinism test
- Knowledge base: nearest‚Äëup spec, timestamps-only-for-sorting, centralized sorting rule

### üîú Next
- Sweep remaining utilities/viewers for centralized sorter (confirm no stragglers)
- Add a short section in KB for new desktop hotkeys (p [ ] \\ and A/S/D/F/B)
- Optional: regression runner to exercise desktop 4-up flows + copy/skip

## üß† AI Select+Crop Training Plan (authoritative source)

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Logging (no workflow disruption)
1. Desktop: add `--log-training` flag; on Enter write one CSV row to `data/training/select_crop_log.csv`
   - Columns: session_id, set_id, directory, image_count, chosen_index, chosen_path,
     crop_x1,y1,x2,y2 (normalized), image_i_path/stage, width_i/height_i, timestamp
   - Fail-open (try/except); create directory if missing; append mode
2. Web selector: on batch finalize write selection-only rows to `data/training/selection_only_log.csv`
   - Columns: session_id, set_id, chosen_path, neg_paths(list/JSON), timestamp
3. KB: add short section documenting flags, file locations, schemas

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Dataset builder
1. Script: `scripts/datasets/build_select_crop_dataset.py`
2. Inputs: the two CSVs; validate file existence
3. Split by set_id into train/val/test (80/10/10)
4. Outputs:
   - Ranking pairs (chosen, negative) JSONL
   - Crop samples (image, bbox) JSONL
   - (Optional) COCO JSON for bbox visualization

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Training (two-head)
1. Script: `scripts/train/train_select_crop.py` (PyTorch+timm)
2. Backbone ViT-B/16; heads: ranking (embedding+MarginRankingLoss) + bbox (SmoothL1+IoU)
3. Loss: total = 1.0*L_rank + 2.0*L_bbox (tunable)
4. Optimizer: AdamW (backbone 3e-5..5e-5; heads 1e-4); cosine decay; 10‚Äì30 epochs; amp

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Evaluation
1. Script: `scripts/eval/eval_select_crop.py` (Top-1, IoU@0.5, mean IoU, MAE)
2. Notebook: `notebooks/eval_select_crop.ipynb` with qualitative side-by-sides

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Inference integration (desktop)
1. Flag `--ai-suggest` to enable
2. On batch: score images ‚Üí suggest top-1; predict crop for top-1; draw suggested rect
3. Hotkeys: T toggle suggestions; Y accept suggested selection+crop (user can tweak)
4. No auto-submit; always user-controlled

### Environment & repos
- pip: torch torchvision timm albumentations scikit-learn pycocotools tqdm pyyaml rich
- Sorting rule: ALWAYS pre-sort with `sort_image_files_by_timestamp_and_stage`
- Normalize crop coords to [0..1]; split by set_id to avoid leakage

## üîê Data Backup Plan (new project)

Goal: Automated, reliable off-repo backups of important CSV/log data.

Scope (include):
- `data/training/*.csv` (select_crop_log.csv, selection_only_log.csv)
- `data/file_operations_logs/*.log`
- Optional: manifests (hashes/counts) for verification

Out of scope (exclude):
- All image assets and large binaries (already backed up elsewhere)

Tasks:
1. Choose backend (S3 or Backblaze B2; fallback: Google Drive)
2. Create backup script `scripts/backup/backup_training_data.py`
   - Packages files into a timestamped tar.gz (UTC)
   - Writes a manifest with sha256 + row counts
   - Uploads to backend with lifecycle policy (e.g., keep 8 weekly)
3. Add restore script `scripts/backup/restore_training_data.py` (id or latest)
4. Schedule weekly cron (Sun 02:00 local)
5. Run an end‚Äëto‚Äëend test: backup ‚Üí delete temp copy ‚Üí restore ‚Üí verify manifest
6. Document in KB (runbook + env vars)

Defaults:
- Frequency: Weekly (daily is unnecessary for current volume)
- Retention: 8 weeks
- Encryption: Server‚Äëside (S3 SSE) or key‚Äëbased client encryption (optional)

## üöÄ **CURRENT PRIORITIES**

### **üêõ Bug Fixes (High Priority)**
1. **Fix desktop image selector crop tool selection toggle** - When one image is selected by hotkey and then another image's crop position is modified, the original image doesn't toggle back to delete
   - **Issue**: Only one image should be kept at a time, but selection doesn't auto-toggle
   - **Impact**: UX issue during long image processing sessions
   - **Priority**: High - affects daily workflow

### **üîß Technical Improvements**
2. ~~**Implement canonical stage ladder approach**~~ - **CANCELLED** - Would break existing workflow
   - **Decision**: Current system works well for 7,000+ image processing workflow
   - **Current behavior**: Groups `1‚Üí2‚Üí3` (skips 1.5) - this is what we want
   - **Canonical approach**: Would NOT group `1‚Üí2‚Üí3` (requires `1‚Üí1.5‚Üí2‚Üí3`) - too strict
   - **Conclusion**: Current "any increasing stages" approach is better for this workflow

2. **Improve test coverage and quality** - Current tests are good but could be more comprehensive
   - **Current test strengths**: Tests all valid combinations, edge cases, comprehensive coverage
   - **Test improvements needed**:
     - **Add unsorted input tests** - Verify pre-sorting requirement is enforced
     - **Add unknown stage handling** - Test behavior with unexpected stage numbers
     - **Add min_group_size variations** - Test different grouping thresholds
     - **Add two-runs-in-sequence tests** - Test multiple separate groups
     - **Add edge case tests** - Test same stages, backwards progression, gaps
   - **Test quality insights**:
     - Current tests use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` - good practice
     - Current tests validate exact group counts and sizes - excellent
     - Need tests that would catch the "same stage grouping" bug we had
   - **Priority**: Medium - improve test robustness and coverage

### **üìö Future Analysis & Development**
4. **Create missing test files** - Need tests for: `02_face_grouper.py`, `04_multi_crop_tool.py`, `06_web_duplicate_finder.py`
5. **Create utility tests** - Need tests for: `utils/character_processor.py`, `utils/duplicate_checker.py`, `utils/recursive_file_mover.py`, `utils/similarity_viewer.py`, `utils/triplet_deduplicator.py`, `utils/triplet_mover.py`
6. **Analyze coverage report** - Review `scripts/tests/htmlcov/index.html` for coverage gaps
7. **Improve code coverage** - Focus on increasing test coverage for critical scripts
8. **Catalog conventions** - Analyze all scripts for reusable patterns and create reference docs
9. **Root directory cleanup** - Check files in root directory to see if they need to be cleaned out or moved to a special directory
10. **Create local homepage** - Build custom homepage in Documents directory with links to all AI systems and tools from Google homepage
11. **Investigate Claude memory configuration** - Look into enabling memory tool in Cursor/Claude settings to improve session continuity and knowledge retention

## üìö MAJOR ANALYSIS PROJECT: Code Conventions & Patterns

### **üéØ Catalog Conventions (Main Task)**
**Analyze all scripts to identify reusable patterns and conventions**
- **Goal**: Create comprehensive reference for consistent development
- **Scope**: All scripts in `/scripts/` directory and utilities
- **Output**: `Documents/CONVENTIONS_REFERENCE.md` with templates and best practices
- **Benefits**: Consistency, efficiency, maintainability, easier onboarding, reduced bugs
- **Strategy**: Tackle after quick wins for momentum

### **üåê Web Tool Conventions Analysis**
**Analyze web tools for common patterns:**
- **Scripts**: 01_web_image_selector, 03_web_character_sorter, 05_web_multi_directory_viewer, 06_web_duplicate_finder
- **Patterns to catalog**:
  - Flask structure and routing patterns
  - CSS classes and styling conventions
  - JavaScript functions and modules
  - UI components and layouts
  - Error handling patterns
  - File upload/processing workflows

### **üñ•Ô∏è Desktop Tool Conventions Analysis**
**Analyze desktop tools for common patterns:**
- **Scripts**: 01_desktop_image_selector_crop, 04_batch_crop_tool_multi
- **Patterns to catalog**:
  - Matplotlib setup and event handling
  - File processing workflows
  - Progress tracking systems
  - UI layouts and interactions
  - Keyboard/mouse event handling

### **üîÑ Cross-Platform Conventions Analysis**
**Identify patterns that work across both web and desktop:**
- **Shared utilities**: FileTracker and ActivityTimer usage patterns
- **Common workflows**: Progress tracking and session management
- **Infrastructure**: Error handling and logging patterns
- **File operations**: Directory scanning and image processing
- **Safety patterns**: File operations and data protection

### **üìñ Create Conventions Reference**
**Build comprehensive documentation:**
- **Location**: `Documents/CONVENTIONS_REFERENCE.md`
- **Content**: Code templates and best practices
- **Organization**: Categorized by tool type and functionality
- **Templates**: Ready-to-use code snippets for common patterns
- **Examples**: Real code examples from existing tools

## üéØ STRATEGIC APPROACH

### **üìã Task Categories & Priority**
1. **üöÄ QUICK WINS** - Knock out first 3-4 items quickly for momentum
2. **üìã MAINTENANCE TASKS** - Test maintenance section (completed items for reference)
3. **üéØ WORKFLOW TASKS** - Photo processing workflow, identify and process directories
4. **üìö ANALYSIS TASKS** - Bigger projects (catalog conventions, analyze patterns, create reference docs)

### **‚ö° Execution Strategy**
**When you return:**
1. **Start with Quick Wins** - Git issue, redundant text, title updates (build momentum)
2. **Tackle Single Keep Logic** - More complex but well-defined
3. **Move to Analysis Projects** - When we have more time for comprehensive work

**Key Insight**: The git tracking issue should definitely be first - that's probably just a simple configuration or path issue that we can solve in minutes!

## üîç Future Investigation Items

### **Web Interface Template System**
**Investigate template design for web tools consolidation:**
- **Scope**: 01_web_image_selector, 03_web_character_sorter, 05_web_multi_directory_viewer
- **Common elements**: Same header, color palette (WEB_STYLE_GUIDE.md), similar JavaScript patterns
- **Shared functionality**: Image clicking, delete buttons, crop operations, navigation
- **Goal**: Determine if template would simplify maintenance or add complexity
- **Benefits**: Easier updates, consistent UI, reduced code duplication
- **Considerations**: Balance between reusability and tool-specific customization
