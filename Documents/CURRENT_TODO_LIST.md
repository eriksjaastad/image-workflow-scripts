## üéØ Active Tasks

### Phase 3: AI-Assisted Reviewer Testing

#### Ready to Use Today!
- [ ] **Test AI-Assisted Reviewer on New Project** [PRIORITY: HIGH]
  - **Status:** Tool exists at `scripts/01_ai_assisted_reviewer.py`
  - **Purpose:** REPLACES Web Image Selector - looks at ALL images, selects best from each group, proposes crops
  - **Currently:** Rule-based (picks highest stage, no crop proposals)
  - **Future:** Will integrate Ranker v3 + Crop Proposer models
  - **Usage:** `python scripts/01_ai_assisted_reviewer.py <new-project-directory>/`
  - **Test Plan:**
    1. Start new project with raw images
    2. Run AI-Assisted Reviewer instead of Web Image Selector
    3. Review AI recommendations (A to approve, 1-4 to override)
    4. Check .decision sidecar files are created
    5. Evaluate if this workflow is better than manual selection

#### Model Integration (Optional - Already Have Great Models)
- [ ] Integrate Ranker v3 into AI-Assisted Reviewer
  - **Ranker v3 stats:** 94.4% anomaly accuracy, 98.1% overall
  - **Replace:** Rule-based logic with model predictions
  - **Add:** Confidence scores from model
- [ ] Integrate Crop Proposer v1 (if it completed training)
  - **Check:** Does `crop_proposer_v1.pt` exist?
  - **Add:** Crop suggestions to reviewer UI

## üìÖ Backlog

### Historical Crop Data Extraction (Experiment)
- [ ] **Extract crop coordinates from historical projects using image matching** [PRIORITY: MEDIUM]
  - **Goal:** Recover thousands of crop training examples by comparing original vs cropped images
  - **Method:** 
    1. Use project manifests to identify date ranges
    2. Find cropped images (files within project date range in `_cropped/` or `_final/` directories)
    3. Find matching original images (same filename in original/raw directory)
    4. Use OpenCV template matching to find exact crop location
    5. Extract crop coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
    6. Normalize coordinates (0.0-1.0 range)
    7. Write to training CSV or SQLite (decide which)
  - **Why This Will Work:**
    - No compression/resizing in workflow = exact pixel match
    - Template matching will find location with 99.9%+ confidence
    - Fast processing (seconds per image)
  - **Implementation:**
    - Proof of concept: Test on 10 image pairs first
    - Visual verification: Show matches overlaid
    - Batch processing: Process all historical projects
    - Validation: Manual review of sample matches
  - **Potential Value:**
    - Could recover 5,000-10,000 crop training examples
    - Dramatically improve Crop Proposer model
    - Learn from historical crop patterns
  - **Output Format:**
    - Training data (not decision tracking)
    - Either: Add to crop training CSV
    - Or: Store in separate "recovered_crops.csv"
    - Include: timestamp, project_id, filename, crop_coords, image_width, image_height
  - **Projects to Process:**
    - Mojo1, Mojo2 (and any other finished projects with original + cropped pairs)
  - **Status:** EXPERIMENT - Build proof of concept first, then scale if successful

### Documentation
- [ ] Document training data structure rules in `AI_TRAINING_DATA_STRUCTURE.md`
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common training issues

### Dashboard Improvements
- [ ] **Reimagine/Simplify Productivity Dashboard** [PRIORITY: MEDIUM]
  - **Issue:** Too many graphs that aren't actually useful
  - **Keep:** 
    - Build vs Actual (helpful, locked in)
    - Billing Efficiency Tracker (fine)
    - Productivity Table (pretty good)
    - Input vs Output (favorite graph)
  - **Reconsider/Remove:**
    - Project Comparison (confusing - operations > total images?)
    - Files Processed by Project (lines too small, hard to read with many projects)
    - Other graphs that don't provide clear insights
  - **Improvements Needed:**
    - Make it easier to view just last 2-3 projects together (not all at once)
    - Better default filters (e.g., only show recent projects by default)
    - Larger/clearer visualizations (especially for time-series)
    - Consider minimum thresholds for graphs (500+ files?) to avoid flatlined data
  - **Goal:** Less overwhelming, more focused on actionable insights

- [ ] **Add AI Performance Stats to Dashboard** [PRIORITY: HIGH]
  - **Data Source:** SQLite v3 databases (`data/training/ai_training_decisions/*.db`)
  - **Metrics to Show:**
    - **Selection Accuracy:** % of times AI picked the same image as user
    - **Crop Accuracy:** % of times AI's crop was within 5% of user's final crop
    - **Trend Over Time:** Is AI getting better as it trains on more data?
    - **Per-Project Stats:** Compare AI performance across Mojo1, Mojo2, Mojo3, etc.
    - **Confidence Calibration:** Does high AI confidence = correct prediction?
  - **Visualizations:**
    - Line graph: Selection accuracy over time (by project)
    - Bar chart: AI correct vs user override (per project)
    - Gauge: Current AI accuracy (like a speedometer)
    - Table: Detailed breakdown (total decisions, correct, wrong, accuracy %)
  - **Why This Is Awesome:**
    - See AI improvement in real-time as you work!
    - Know when to trust AI's suggestions more
    - Celebrate milestones (50% accuracy ‚Üí 70% ‚Üí 85%!)
    - Identify which types of images AI struggles with
  - **Implementation:**
    - Query SQLite databases for `selection_match` and `crop_match` flags
    - Group by project and timestamp
    - Calculate rolling accuracy (e.g., last 100 decisions)
    - Display prominently on dashboard (maybe top section?)

### Automation
- [ ] Set up daily validation report (cron job or manual)
- [ ] Add email/Slack alerts when validation fails

## üìù Notes

- **Data Collection Crisis:** Discovered 3 weeks after the fact that Desktop Multi-Crop was logging dimensions as (0,0) instead of actual values. Lost ~6,700 potential training examples. Need real-time validation to prevent this in the future.
- **Embeddings Issue:** Some embeddings exist in cache but files are missing from disk. Need verification step after embedding generation.
- **Historical Data Limitation:** Only projects processed AFTER data collection system was built have usable crop data.
