# AI Documentation Summary & Update Log

**Status:** Documentation Complete ‚úÖ

## üìã What Was Done Today (Oct 20, 2025)

### üîç Investigation: Training Data Verification
**Issue:** User was concerned that Mojo 2 training data might be missing (expected 40k+ examples)

**Investigation Results:**
- ‚úÖ Mojo 1: 5,244 selections + 1 crop
- ‚úÖ Mojo 2: 4,594 selections + 0 crops
- ‚úÖ **Total: 9,838 selections** (both projects captured correctly!)

**Crop Data Clarification:**
- The 7,194 crop entries are from Multi Crop Tool, not AI-Assisted Reviewer
- These are from `crop/` directory and character subdirectories
- Logged on Oct 4, 8, 16, 19, 2025
- This is expected - AI-Assisted Reviewer doesn't log crops (it sends to Multi Crop Tool)

**Final Count: 17,032 total training examples ‚úÖ**
- 9,838 selection decisions (which image is best)
- 7,194 crop decisions (where to crop)

## üéØ Why This System Works

### **Problem:** Losing context between AI sessions
**Solution:** Every document now has:
1. **Quick Navigation** - Links to related docs with phase labels
2. **Status indicators** - Know what's done, what's next
3. **Update timestamps** - Know if info is current
4. **Cross-references** - Easy to find related information

### **Problem:** Forgetting what's been completed
**Solution:** `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with:
1. **Checkboxes for every task** - Visual progress tracking
2. **Status markers** (‚úÖ‚è≥üìã) - At-a-glance phase status
3. **Notes sections** - Document lessons learned
4. **"Update this document" reminder** - In every phase

### **Problem:** Not knowing where to start
**Solution:** Clear hierarchy:
1. **Start:** `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (master checklist)
2. **Phase 2:** `AI_TRAINING_PHASE2_QUICKSTART.md` (step-by-step)
3. **Phase 3:** `archives/misc/AUTOMATION_REVIEWER_SPEC.md` (UI spec)
4. **Reference:** Other docs as needed

## üîÑ How to Keep Documentation Updated

### After Completing Any Phase Task:

1. **Open:** `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
2. **Check off:** Completed checkbox ‚úÖ
3. **Add notes:** In "Notes & Lessons Learned" section
4. **Update status:** Change ‚è≥ to ‚úÖ if phase complete
5. **Update metrics:** Fill in "Actual" results
6. **Update timestamp:** At bottom of document

### After Making Any Code Changes:

1. **Update:** Relevant technical docs (if needed)
2. **Update:** `scripts/ai/README.md` (if new scripts)
3. **Note in:** Implementation Plan

### When Starting New AI Session:

1. **Read:** `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` first
2. **Check:** What's marked complete
3. **Find:** Next unchecked task
4. **Reference:** Linked docs as needed

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before ending any AI session, verify:

- [ ] All completed tasks are checked off
- [ ] All new documents are listed in AI_DOCUMENTS_INDEX.md
- [ ] All updated documents have new timestamps
- [ ] AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md is current
- [ ] Any new files are documented
- [ ] Any lessons learned are noted

## üöÄ Next Session Quick Start

**When you start next session:**

1. Read this document first (you are here!)
2. Open `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
3. Find the first unchecked box in Phase 2
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions
5. Update documentation as you go

**Estimated time to get oriented: 2-3 minutes**

## üìù Document Maintenance Notes

### Documents That Should Update Frequently:
- `AI_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - After every task
- `CURRENT_TODO_LIST.md` - As overall project evolves

### Documents That Update Occasionally:
- `AI_TRAINING_PHASE2_QUICKSTART.md` - When Phase 2 details change
- `AUTOMATION_REVIEWER_SPEC.md` - When UI requirements change
- `AI_DOCUMENTS_INDEX.md` - When new docs are created

### Documents That Rarely Update:

## üéì Lessons Learned (Oct 20, 2025)

### What Worked Well:
1. ‚úÖ Systematic verification of training data sources
2. ‚úÖ Clear breakdown of what data comes from which tool
3. ‚úÖ Adding navigation sections to all docs
4. ‚úÖ Creating master checklist for complex multi-phase project

### What to Remember:
1. üí° AI-Assisted Reviewer logs selections, not crops (crops happen in Multi Crop Tool)
2. üí° Always verify data sources when counts seem off
3. üí° Documentation should answer "what's next?" not just "what exists?"
4. üí° Checkboxes are powerful for never losing place in long projects

### For Future Documentation Projects:
1. üìå Add "Quick Navigation" sections to all related docs
2. üìå Create master checklist for any multi-phase work
3. üìå Include update timestamps on all docs
4. üìå Cross-reference related documents explicitly
