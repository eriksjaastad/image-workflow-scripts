# Data Consolidation System

## Purpose
Describe how dashboard data is consolidated from daily summaries and detailed logs for tests and local development.

## Data Sources
- Daily summaries: `data/daily_summaries/`
- File operation logs: `data/file_operations_logs/` and `data/log_archives/`

## Consolidation Logic
- Prefer daily aggregates when present to speed reads.
- Fill gaps with per-operation logs.
- Normalize timestamps to UTC Z and align to baseline labels (`15min`, `1H`, `D`, `W`, `M`).
- Produce merged tables for:
  - Images per hour (IPH)
  - Operation counts over time
  - Project comparisons

## Testing Considerations
- Provide small fixture windows (e.g., 7â€“30 days) for fast runs.
- Ensure deterministic ordering for unit tests.
- Validate that merged series length matches baseline labels.

## Operational Notes
- Consolidation is executed inside the dashboard analytics layer.
- For local dev, rebuild aggregates as needed to reflect the latest logs.
