# Data Consolidation System

This document describes the consolidation flow for dashboard data in tests.

- Daily summaries live in `data/daily_summaries/`.
- Detailed file operations live in `data/file_operations_logs/` and `data/log_archives/`.
- The dashboard engine merges both sources, preferring daily summaries when present.

Test stub: This file exists to satisfy tests that verify documentation presence.
